//During the weekend, Ross Geller has decided to conduct some team games. 
//He wants to split his friends into equal-sized teams. In some cases,
//some friends may be left out of the teams, and he wanted to use the 
//left-out friends to assist him in conducting the team games. For instance,
//if there are 50 friends and they have to be divided into 7 equal-sized teams, 
//then there will be 7 in each team and 1 friend will be left out. Ross asks
//for your help to automate this team-splitting task. Can you please help him out?
//Input consists of 2 integers. 
//The first integer corresponds to the number of friends Ross has. 
//The second integer corresponds to the number of teams.
