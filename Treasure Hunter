Though there have been more successful pirates, Blackbeard is one
of the best-known and widely feared of his time. He commanded four 
ships and had a pirate army of 300 at the height of his career and 
defeated the famous warship, HMS “Scarborough” in a sea battle. 
He was known for barreling into the battle clutching two swords
with several knives and pistols at the ready. He captured over
forty merchant ships in the Caribbean and without flinching killed 
many prisoners. Now, Blackbeard and his three pirates found a
treasure of gold coins. Long Ben too joined them. They decided
to share the treasure. Blackbeard agreed to give x% share for
Long Ben. He then decided to take y% share from the remaining
treasure. His other pirates will share the remaining gold coins equally.
Write a program to compute their shares. After sharing the gold coins 
in this manner, if there are any leftover coins they decided to throw them into the sea.


Input Format
Input consists of 3 integers. The first input corresponds to the number of gold coins in the treasure.
The second input corresponds to Ben's share percentage. The last input corresponds to Blackbeard's share percentage.

Output Format
The output consists of three integers. The first output integer corresponds to Long Ben's share.
The second output integer corresponds to Blackbeard's share. The third output should correspond 
to the other 3 pirates' equally divided shares.
