/*In Westeros, the fighting ground is rectangular in shape. The King of Westeros,
Bran Stark decides to build a fence around the ground. In order to help the 
construction workers to build a straight fence, he planned to place a thick 
rope around the ground. He decided to buy a rope of length that exactly fits
the boundary. He also wanted to cover the entire ground with a thick carpet 
during the rainy season. The carpet should also be bought in such a way that
it exactly covers the entire ground. Being the three-eyed Raven, he was lost
in his thoughts and requested your help. Can you please help King Bran by 
writing a program to find the exact length of the rope and the exact 
area of the carpet that is required?

Hint:
Area of rectangle = length * breadth
perimeter of a rectangle = 2* (length + breadth)

Input Format:

Input consists of 2 integers. 
The first integer corresponds to the length of the ground. 
The second integer corresponds to the breadth of the ground.

Output Format:

Refer to the sample Input and Output for exact formatting specifications.*/
