// Having crossed the three-headed faun, Harry, Dumbledore, and Snape
// went through a secret trap door in search of the Sorcerer's tomb.
// On the way, they passed through a room and found that the room 
// has only one door opposite to them, and the door through which they entered 
// shut once they entered the room. The door was very large with a four-digit
// number imprinted on it. When Harry and Dumbledore tried to open it by
// casting out spells, it didn't open. Having tried various spells, both
// got fed up and left the task to Snape. Snape curiously observing the
// room found that a statement was written on the top of the room. It was
// written as follows "I will be always four" “I can only be opened when 
// you add my first and last digit and enter it” and “If you find a sign,
// you should not consider it” help Snape break the code and open the
// door so that they can save the Sorcerer's tomb.
