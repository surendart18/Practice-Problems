Pradeep is designing the input interaction for X-O game (a.k.a TIC-TAC-TOE). 
The user identifies the positions as 1|2|3 4|5|6| 7|8|9. 
Since the board is a 2-dimensional layout (3x3), 
Pradeep uses a 2-dimensional array to store board status 
and he identifies positions by row, and column as for 
first-row elements -(0,0),(0,1),(0,2) andfor second-row elements
- (1,0),(1,1),(1,2) and for 3rd row elements - (2,0),(2,1),(2,2).
Help Pradeep to solve the conversion from user's input (1-9) 
to (Row, Column) (0-2),(0-2) respectively.

Note - Indexing for rows and columns is 0-based.

Input Format
Only line of input will contain one integer n

Constraints
1 <= n <= 9

Output Format
By using the input, you have to tell the row and column number associated with it.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
   int n;
  cin>>n;
  int row=(n-1)/3;
  int column=(n-1)%3;
  cout<<row<<" "<<column;
    return 0;
}
